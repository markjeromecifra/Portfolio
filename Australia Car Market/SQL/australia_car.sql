The client wants to identify potential outliers in the pricing of the vehicles. 
Calculate the average price of vehicles per brand and then list any vehicles priced above 1.5 times the 
standard deviation from the brandâ€™s average price. For each outlier, provide the ID, Name, Brand, Price, 
and the difference from the average price.

The client suspects that fuel type might influence the likelihood of selling the vehicles quickly.
